# FizzBuzz

Saw some guys on /g/ talking about FizzBuzz, specifically about where the check for %15 should be. I didn't see why you'd want to check for "FizzBuzz" when it's clearly meant to be a concatenation of Fizz and Buzz. This is my solution to the problem: start with an empty string, add Fizz if divisible by 3, add Buzz if divisible by 5, write number if still empty.
